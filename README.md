Welcome to my github page. Here you will find a bunch of scripts that I use to automate my home.

I own a bunch of Raspberry Pi's, and Pi Zeros at home. All of them are wirelessly connected to my home network, and can talk to each other seemlessly via mqtt messaging. Mqtt is used only because it is light weight, loosely couples devices from each other, and provides data persistence. The devices can work independently to each other and can be taken off-line without having to worry - making it easy for me to do plug-and-play work :)

The following picture shows high level architecture of my home network, and what I use for basic automation stuff at home.
