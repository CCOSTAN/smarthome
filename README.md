**Welcome** to my github page. Here you will find a bunch of scripts that I use to automate my home.

I own a bunch of Raspberry Pi's, and Pi Zeros at home. The primary Home Automation software I use is [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) (HA). It is an open-source home automation platform written by a bunch of smart individuals. Using HA, one can track and control all devices at home. It is a perfect piece of software to run on a Raspberry Pi.

All of the Raspberry Pi's I have at home are wirelessly connected to my home network, and can talk to each other seemlessly via mqtt messaging. Mqtt is used only because it is light weight, loosely couples devices from each other, and provides data persistence. The devices can work independently to each other and can be taken off-line without having to worry - making it easy for me to do plug-and-play work :)

The following picture shows high level architecture of my home network, and what I use for basic automation stuff at home.

Please feel free to let me know if you find any issues with my code, and/or have any suggestions. Thank you!
